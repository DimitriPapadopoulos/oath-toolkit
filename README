The OATH Toolkit contains a shared library, command line tool and a
PAM module that makes it possible to build one-time password
authentication systems.  Supported technologies include the
event-based HOTP algorithm and the time-based TOTP algorithm.  OATH is
the Open AuTHentication organization which specify the algorithms.

The components included in the package is:

  * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

  * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

  * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.
