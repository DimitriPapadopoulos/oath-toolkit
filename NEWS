* Version 1.8.1 (released 2011-05-03)

** build: Make autoreconf work again.
Reported by Christian Hesse <list@eworm.de>.

* Version 1.8.0 (released 2011-05-03)

** liboath: Add new APIs oath_strerror and oath_strerror_name.
The functions are used to get a human readable description of liboath
error codes.  Suggested by Christian Hesse <mail@eworm.de>.

** liboath: Self-tests improvements.

* Version 1.6.4 (released 2011-05-01)

** liboath: Increase usersfile max secret length to 32 bytes.
Reported by Mitya <mitya@cargosoft.ru>.

** oathtool: Support --window together with --totp.

** pam_oath: Re-add the pam_sm_setcred function and make it return success.
Apparently the function need to exist even if it is not used.
Reported by Christian Hesse <list@eworm.de>.

** pam_oath: Link to -lpam for PAM symbols.
Reported by Mitya <mitya@cargosoft.ru>.

** pam_oath: Don't install pam_oath.la file.
Reported by Mitya <mitya@cargosoft.ru>.

** build: Use pammoddir automake variable instead of overriding libdir.
Reported by Mitya <mitya@cargosoft.ru>.

** build: Make autoreconf work in released tar archives.
Reported by Mitya <mitya@cargosoft.ru>.

* Version 1.6.3 (released 2011-04-25)

** pam_oath: Work under SSH by no-op'ing the setcred function.
Reported by Fanis Dokianakis <fanis@infloop.gr>.

** build: Fix srcdir != builddir issues.
Patches from Linus Nordberg <linus@nordberg.se>.

** build: Gnulib files were updated.

* Version 1.6.2 (released 2011-03-10)

** pam_oath: Add ./configure --enable-root-tests parameter.
Now this configure parameter is needed to run the self-tests that
needs root permission.  The fix in the last release was apparently not
sufficient.  Reported by Jean-Michel Pouré - GOOZE <jmpoure@gooze.eu>.

* Version 1.6.1 (released 2011-02-22)

** pam_oath: Improve reliability of root self test when /etc is not writable.
Reported by Jean-Michel Pouré - GOOZE <jmpoure@gooze.eu>.

* Version 1.6.0 (released 2011-02-22)

** liboath: Added APIs to perform TOTP validation.
The APIs are oath_totp_validate and oath_totp_validate_callback,
similar to the corresponding HOTP functions.

** liboath: The function type oath_hotp_validate_strcmp_function was
** renamed to oath_validate_strcmp_function.
It is used by both HOTP and TOTP validation.  The old name will
continue to work through a compatibility-#define.

** oathtool: Support TOTP validation.

* Version 1.4.6 (released 2011-02-07)

** liboath: Improve portability by using more gnulib modules.
Some non-portable constructions were fixed.  From now on gnulib will
warn for some non-portable constructs.

** Fix some minor clang warnings.

* Version 1.4.5 (released 2011-01-27)

** liboath: Make sure gnulib files are licensed under the LGPLv2.1+.
Thanks to Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@debian.org>.

* Version 1.4.4 (released 2011-01-27)

** liboath: Fix OATH_VERSION and OATH_VERSION_NUMBER.
I forgot to increment these symbols for the last release.  From now
on, these symbols are generated from the package version instead.

** oathtool: Fix typo in man page.
Patch from Linus Nordberg <linus@nordberg.se>.

* Version 1.4.3 (released 2011-01-20)

** liboath: Really make usersfile logic for '-' passwords work.
Reported by Michael Stevens <mstevens@etla.org>.

** pam_oath: Added better self-test suite (requires root privileges).

* Version 1.4.2 (released 2011-01-16)

** oathtool: Really replace - with \- in man page, pointed out by lintian.
We now also have a self check to catch any regressions in this area.

** liboath: Make TOTP self check work on platforms with 32-bit time_t.
The final test requires >32 bit time_t.

* Version 1.4.1 (released 2011-01-16)

** liboath: New configure parameter --enable-gcc-warnings.
Use to enable many compiler warnings.  Enabled by default during
development.

** oathtool: Replace - with \- in man page, pointed out by lintian.

* Version 1.4.0 (released 2011-01-15)

** liboath: Added pkg-config script.

** liboath: Support time-variant TOTP based on draft-mraihi-totp-timebased-07.
New function oath_totp_generate.  New symbols
OATH_TOTP_DEFAULT_TIME_STEP_SIZE and OATH_TOTP_DEFAULT_START_TIME for
default system parameters.

** liboath: New API oath_hotp_validate_callback().
Used when you are validating hashed OTPs.  Inspired by discussions
with Daniel Pocock <daniel@pocock.com.au>.

** oathtool: New parameter --totp to generate time-variant TOTP's.
New sub-parameter --time-step-size, --start-time and --now used to
specify TOTP configuration.

** liboath: Added self-tests of validate functions.

* Version 1.2.2 (released 2011-01-01)

** Cleanups related to name change.

* Version 1.2.1 (released 2010-12-28)

** liboath: Install header file "oath.h".
And various other namespace cleanups.

* Version 1.2.0 (released 2010-12-27)

** Project renamed from "HOTP Toolkit" to "OATH Toolkit".

** liboath: The header file is "oath.h" and library is "liboath.so".
Functions were renamed, but functionality is retained so updating code
is a matter of changing the symbol names only.

** oathtool: Renamed from "hotptool".  Added --hotp flag (the default).
This is to plan for the future when the tool will also support TOTP/OCRA.

** pam_oath: Renamed from pam_hotp.

* Version 1.0.1 (released 2010-12-27)

** libhotp: Fix build failure due to missing sys/stat.h include on FreeBSD 7.2.
Reported by Kevin Quinlan <Kevin.Quinlan@polidoris.com>.

** libhotp: Make usersfile logic for '-' passwords work.
Reported by Rick van Rein <rick@openfortress.nl>.

** libhotp DOC: Added GTK-DOC manual in PDF format.

** build: Gnulib files were updated.

* Version 1.0.0 (released 2009-12-08)

** Initial release.
