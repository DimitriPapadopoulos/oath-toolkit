We now also have a self check to catch any regressions in this area.

The final test requires >32 bit time_t.

* Version 1.4.1 (released 2011-01-16)

Use to enable many compiler warnings.  Enabled by default during
development.

* Version 1.4.0 (released 2011-01-15)

** liboath: Added pkg-config script.

** liboath: Support time-variant TOTP based on draft-mraihi-totp-timebased-07.
New function oath_totp_generate.  New symbols
OATH_TOTP_DEFAULT_TIME_STEP_SIZE and OATH_TOTP_DEFAULT_START_TIME for
default system parameters.

** liboath: New API oath_hotp_validate_callback().
Used when you are validating hashed OTPs.  Inspired by discussions
with Daniel Pocock <daniel@pocock.com.au>.

New sub-parameter --time-step-size, --start-time and --now used to
specify TOTP configuration.

** Cleanups related to name change.

* Version 1.2.1 (released 2010-12-28)

And various other namespace cleanups.

* Version 1.2.0 (released 2010-12-27)

** Project renamed from "HOTP Toolkit" to "OATH Toolkit".

** liboath: The header file is "oath.h" and library is "liboath.so".
Functions were renamed, but functionality is retained so updating code
is a matter of changing the symbol names only.

This is to plan for the future when the tool will also support TOTP/OCRA.
