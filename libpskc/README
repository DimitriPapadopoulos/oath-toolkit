Current limitations of Libpskc:

* The EncryptionKey, MACMethod, Signature types are not supported.

* No extensions are implemented.

* Only PlainValue data fields are supported (i.e., EncryptedValue and
  ValueMAC fields are not supported).

Otherwise Libpskc is believed to be a complete PSKC implementation
conforming to the PSKC standard RFC 6030.
