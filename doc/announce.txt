Subject: OATH Toolkit 1.4.2
<#part sign=pgpmime>
More small bug fixes noticed when building dpkg packages...

New in this release:

** oathtool: Really replace - with \- in man page, pointed out by lintian.
We now also have a self check to catch any regressions in this area.

** liboath: Make TOTP self check work on platforms with 32-bit time_t.
The final test requires >32 bit time_t.

The OATH Toolkit attempts to collect several tools that are useful when
deploying technologies related to OATH.  For example, see RFC 4226 on
OATH HOTP.  The components included in the package is:

   * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

   * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

   * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.

Consider this release experimental!  Please report any issues with it,
especially with the shared library.
