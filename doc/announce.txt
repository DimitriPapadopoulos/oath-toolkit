<#part sign=pgpmime>
Hi!  This release contains a bunch of smaller fixes.

** libpskc: New --with-xmlsec-crypto-engine to hard-code crypto engine.
Fixes <https://gitlab.com/oath-toolkit/oath-toolkit/-/issues/16>.
Use it like --with-xmlsec-crypto-engine=gnutls or
--with-xmlsec-crypto-engine=openssl if the default dynamic loading
fails because of runtime linker search path issues.

** oathtool --totp --verbose now prints TOTP hash mode.
Fixes <https://gitlab.com/oath-toolkit/oath-toolkit/-/issues/4>.

** oathtool: Hash names (e.g., SHA256) for --totp are now upper case.
Fixes <https://gitlab.com/oath-toolkit/oath-toolkit/-/issues/3>.
Lower/mixed case hash names are supported for compatibility.

** pam_oath: Fail gracefully for missing users.
Fixes <https://savannah.nongnu.org/support/index.php?109111>.
This allows you to incrementally add support for OATH authentication
instead of forcing it on all users.  See updated pam_oath/README on
the '[user_unknown=ignore success=ok]' parameter that can now be
supplied to PAM configuration.  Patch by Antoine Beaupré
<anarcat@debian.org>.

** Fix libpskc memory corruption bug.
Fixes <https://savannah.nongnu.org/support/?108736>.  Thanks to David
Woodhouse and Jaroslav Škarvada for report, self check and patch.

** Fix man pages.
Fixes <https://savannah.nongnu.org/support/?108312>.  Thanks to
Jaroslav Škarvada for the patch.

** Build fixes.

Happy hacking,
Simon

The OATH Toolkit makes it easy to build one-time password authentication
systems.  It contains shared libraries, command line tools and a PAM
module.  Supported technologies include the event-based HOTP algorithm
(RFC4226) and the time-based TOTP algorithm (RFC6238).  OATH stands for
Open AuTHentication, which is the organization that specify the
algorithms.  For managing secret key files, the Portable Symmetric Key
Container (PSKC) format described in RFC6030 is supported.

The components included in the package is:

  * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

  * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

  * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.

  * libpskc: A shared and static C library for PSKC handling.

  * pskctool: A command line tool for manipulating PSKC data.
