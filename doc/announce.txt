<#part sign=pgpmime>
Hi everyone!  It has been four long years without a release.  This
release contains no real changes but update the build system and will
serve as a declaration that we are now open for business again.  I plan
to review merge requests and bug reports now, and encourage you to
remind me what I have been missing and help me update any merge requests
so they can be more easily reviewed.

Happy hacking,
Simon

The OATH Toolkit makes it easy to build one-time password authentication
systems.  It contains shared libraries, command line tools and a PAM
module.  Supported technologies include the event-based HOTP algorithm
(RFC4226) and the time-based TOTP algorithm (RFC6238).  OATH stands for
Open AuTHentication, which is the organization that specify the
algorithms.  For managing secret key files, the Portable Symmetric Key
Container (PSKC) format described in RFC6030 is supported.

The components included in the package is:

  * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

  * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

  * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.

  * libpskc: A shared and static C library for PSKC handling.

  * pskctool: A command line tool for manipulating PSKC data.
