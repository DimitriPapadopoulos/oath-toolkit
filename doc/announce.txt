<#part sign=pgpmime>
A small fix for the root PAM self-test...  Debian packages are on
mentors already, Ubuntu packages in PPA are building.

Happy hacking,
Simon

New in this release:

** pam_oath: Improve reliability of root self test when /etc is not writable.
Reported by Jean-Michel Pour√© - GOOZE <jmpoure@gooze.eu>.

The OATH Toolkit makes it easy to build one-time password
authentication systems.  It contains a shared library, a command line
tool and a PAM module.  Supported technologies include the event-based
HOTP algorithm (RFC 4226) and the time-based TOTP algorithm
(draft-mraihi-totp-timebased-07).  OATH stands for Open
AuTHentication, which is the organization that specify the algorithms.

The components included in the package is:

  * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

  * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

  * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.
