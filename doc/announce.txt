Subject: OATH Toolkit 1.4.4
<#part sign=pgpmime>
I noticed that the version numbers in oath.h wasn't updated for the last
release, now it is automatically generated instead.

New in this release:

** liboath: Fix OATH_VERSION and OATH_VERSION_NUMBER.
I forgot to increment these symbols for the last release.  From now
on, these symbols are generated from the package version instead.

** oathtool: Fix typo in man page.
Patch from Linus Nordberg <linus@nordberg.se>.

The OATH Toolkit attempts to collect several tools that are useful when
deploying technologies related to OATH.  For example, see RFC 4226 on
OATH HOTP.  The components included in the package is:

   * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

   * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

   * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.

Consider this release experimental!  Please report any issues with it,
especially with the shared library.
