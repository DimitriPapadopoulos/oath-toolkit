I ran clang's analyzer on the code and it spotted one minor issue in the
PAM module that this release corrects.  Clang gives two other warnings,
but that is for external code and it is only an esthetic problem.

Happy hacking,

New in this release:

** liboath: Improve portability by using more gnulib modules.
Some non-portable constructions were fixed.  From now on gnulib will
warn for some non-portable constructs.

** Fix some minor clang warnings.

The OATH Toolkit attempts to collect several tools that are useful when
deploying technologies related to OATH.  For example, see RFC 4226 on
OATH HOTP.  The components included in the package is:

   * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

   * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

   * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.

Consider this release experimental!  Please report any issues with it,
especially with the shared library.
