<#part sign=pgpmime>
More TOTP-induced timing issues in self checks, discovered by Debian
build bots...  most Debian architectures has 1.10.1 already, soon they
will all have 1.10.2.

Happy hacking,

The OATH Toolkit makes it easy to build one-time password
authentication systems.  It contains a shared library, a command line
tool and a PAM module.  Supported technologies include the event-based
HOTP algorithm (RFC4226) and the time-based TOTP algorithm (RFC6238).
OATH stands for Open AuTHentication, which is the organization that
specify the algorithms.

The components included in the package is:

  * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

  * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

  * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.
