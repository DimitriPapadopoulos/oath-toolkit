Just a small release to get past lintian warnings, for dpkg packages.

New in this release:

** liboath: New configure parameter --enable-gcc-warnings.
Use to enable many compiler warnings.  Enabled by default during

** oathtool: Replace - with \- in man page, pointed out by lintian.

The OATH Toolkit attempts to collect several tools that are useful when
deploying technologies related to OATH.  For example, see RFC 4226 on
OATH HOTP.  The components included in the package is:

   * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

   * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

   * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.

Consider this release experimental!  Please report any issues with it,
especially with the shared library.
