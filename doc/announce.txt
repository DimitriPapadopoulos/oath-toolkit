<#part sign=pgpmime>
Finally there is TOTP support in the PAM module...  I have added self
tests but not done any extensive testing.  Please pick it apart!

Happy hacking,
Simon

* Version 1.10.0 (released 2011-05-24)

** liboath: Added new TOTP validation functions that return search position.
Before the absolute value of the search position was in the return
code of the TOTP validate function, but it seems we need to know
whether the search position was before or after the current time.  The
new functions are oath_totp_validate2 and oath_totp_validate2_callback
and behave the same asoath_totp_validate and
oath_totp_validate_callback, respectively, but they take another
optional 'int*' parameter to store the search position.

** liboath: Usersfile can now validate TOTP as well.
Supported algorithms are HOTP/T30/D and HOTP/T60/D where D is 6, 7, or
8 digits.  This means that the PAM module now supports TOTP as well.

The OATH Toolkit makes it easy to build one-time password
authentication systems.  It contains a shared library, a command line
tool and a PAM module.  Supported technologies include the event-based
HOTP algorithm (RFC4226) and the time-based TOTP algorithm (RFC6238).
OATH stands for Open AuTHentication, which is the organization that
specify the algorithms.

The components included in the package is:

  * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

  * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

  * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.
