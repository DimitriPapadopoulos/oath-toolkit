I really hope the PAM module works now.  I have added a PAM self-test
suite for it so that it checks that it accepts/rejects both one and two
factor logins properly, to catch future regressions in this area.

New in this release:

** libhotp: Really make usersfile logic for '-' passwords work.
Reported by Michael Stevens <mstevens@etla.org>.

** pam_oath: Added better self-test suite (requires root privileges).

The OATH Toolkit attempts to collect several tools that are useful when
deploying technologies related to OATH.  For example, see RFC 4226 on
OATH HOTP.  The components included in the package is:

   * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

   * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

   * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.

Consider this release experimental!  Please report any issues with it,
especially with the shared library.
