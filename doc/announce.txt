The OATH Toolkit makes it easy to build one-time password
authentication systems.  It contains a shared library, a command line
tool and a PAM module.  Supported technologies include the event-based
HOTP algorithm (RFC4226) and the time-based TOTP algorithm (RFC6238).
OATH stands for Open AuTHentication, which is the organization that
specify the algorithms.

The components included in the package is:

  * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

  * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

  * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.
