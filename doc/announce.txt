Subject: OATH Toolkit 1.10.1
<#part sign=pgpmime>
The TOTP code introduced some new time zone problems in the self tests,
this should take care of that.  I will now try to get this into Debian,
so it has a more modern version.

Happy hacking,
Simon

* Version 1.10.1 (released 2011-06-12)

** liboath: Fix self tests to work regardless of local time zone.

** Update gnulib files.

The OATH Toolkit makes it easy to build one-time password
authentication systems.  It contains a shared library, a command line
tool and a PAM module.  Supported technologies include the event-based
HOTP algorithm (RFC4226) and the time-based TOTP algorithm (RFC6238).
OATH stands for Open AuTHentication, which is the organization that
specify the algorithms.

The components included in the package is:

  * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

  * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

  * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.
