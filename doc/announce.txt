Subject: OATH Toolkit 2.2.0
<#part sign=pgpmime>
This release introduces one major PSKC improvement: the library is now
able to create PSKC data, see the new section in the manual about this:
http://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/libpskc-api/pskc-tutorial-libpskc-create.html

Plenty of new functions were added to support this:
http://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/libpskc-api/api-index-2-2-0.html

There were some other changes as well, see below for the details.

Happy hacking,
Simon

* Version 2.2.0 (released 2013-07-07)

** libpskc: Add functions for setting PSKC data.
The new functions are pskc_add_keypackage and all pskc_set_* functions
(see libpskc/include/pskc/keypackage.h).  This allow you to write
programs that generate new PSKC structures.

** liboath: Permit different passwords for different tokens for the same user.
Thanks to Christian Hesse <list@eworm.de>.

** build: Improve building from git with most recent automake and gengetopt.
Thanks to Christian Hesse <list@eworm.de>.

** build: Valgrind is not enabled by default.
It causes too much false positives.  For developers who want, use
--enable-valgrind-tests.  It is still enabled by default when building
From the version controlled sources (see cfg.mk).  Thanks to Christian
Hesse <list@eworm.de>.

** liboath: Make header file usable from C++ (extern "C" guard).
Reported by Alan Markus <alan.markus@gmail.com>.

The OATH Toolkit makes it easy to build one-time password
authentication systems.  It contains shared libraries, command line
tools and a PAM module.  Supported technologies include the
event-based HOTP algorithm (RFC4226) and the time-based TOTP algorithm
(RFC6238).  OATH stands for Open AuTHentication, which is the
organization that specify the algorithms.  For managing secret key
files, the Portable Symmetric Key Container (PSKC) format described in
RFC6030 is supported.

The components included in the package is:

  * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

  * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

  * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.

  * libpskc: A shared and static C library for PSKC handling.

  * pskctool: A command line tool for manipulating PSKC data.
