<#part sign=pgpmime>
I realized we had some fixes that have been waiting for way to long for
a release, so here it is (finally).

Happy hacking,
Simon

* Version 1.10.5 (released 2012-01-03)

** Build fixes.
From Linus Nordberg <linus@nordberg.se> and Arno Hautala
<arno@alum.wpi.edu>.

** Update gnulib files.

The OATH Toolkit makes it easy to build one-time password
authentication systems.  It contains a shared library, a command line
tool and a PAM module.  Supported technologies include the event-based
HOTP algorithm (RFC4226) and the time-based TOTP algorithm (RFC6238).
OATH stands for Open AuTHentication, which is the organization that
specify the algorithms.

The components included in the package is:

  * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

  * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

  * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.
